What mysteries sleep deep within Ubuntu's crash report repository?
Find out in our latest preprint, **[Anatomy of a crash repository][peerj]!**

Ever wonder what functions crash most often? What signals cause the
most crashes (Spoilers: <span class="spoilers"> it's [segfaults][]</span>)? Then
you should read our preprint!

This is a follow-up [my previous paper][partycrasher] with Joshua
Campbell and our supervisor Abram Hindle.
