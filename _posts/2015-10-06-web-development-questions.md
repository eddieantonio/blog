title:  Web Development Interview Questions
---

A while ago, I compiled a list of sample interview questions for
a friend wanting to apply for front-end web development jobs; The
following is what I came up with. It is by no means "complete" or
"comprehensive", but it does contain several items an aspiring applicant
might want to know about. Note: several of these questions are trick
questions meant to mislead a nervous applicant (it's mean, I know, but
gotta be confident about your knowledge!).

That fact that something is on this list **does not** imply that you
*need* to know this to get a web job. Rather, it's perhaps a thing you
may want to learn in your never-ending quest to build your web dev
chops. I recommend the following video by Kathy Sierra on practical
skill-boodling:

## Non-technical questions

Another thing to prepare for are social situations. For example, what do
you do when a client makes an unreasonable request. For example, if
you've styled some text with the color `#000000`, what should you do if
the client requests for you to make it more black?
